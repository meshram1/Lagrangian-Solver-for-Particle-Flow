# Lagrangian-Solver-for-Particle-Flow
A Fortran-based solver that solved the straightforward lagrangian equation to determine the particle's location based on EL model on an unstructured grid.
We find the velocity at the particle's current location using weighted linear interpolation.                                                                                                                                              
Some Results (NASA JPL Nozzle and Boeing's IUS Submerged Nozzle in Thrust-Vectored Configuration respectively).
